##### NVIDIA Deep Learning Algorithm Team (May 2022 - August 2022) 

* I worked in a team of deep learning algorithm engineers and NVIDIA researchers during my internship. I developed a new hierarchical graph neural network model leveraging a cross-attention mechanism for entity resolution tasks. Specifically, I developed the model for the cross-device user matching problem, and the model achieves significantly better performance (5%) compared to the state-of-the-art. I presented this work at an internal main event held by the Vice President of engineering at NVIDIA.

##### John Deere Machine Learning Team (May 2020 - May 2022) 

*  I developed a fully automated and visual-based local navigation and docking method for John Deere robot mower. I employed the developed method on a larger scale and as a parking assist for the Fairway mower. I used deep learning object detection followed by a deep Q-network (reinforcement learning agent) in a serial fashion. This innovation was selected as top 3 technical innovation at UIUC research park (among about 840 interns in summer 2020. Paper available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9426091).

* I utilized vision autoencoders for noise reduction in planting conditions.

* I developed a visual-based precision planting method using deep learning for seed depth and trench profile measurement.

* I developed an optimized mowing assist using a combination of deep learning semantic segmentation and scene reconstruction algorithms.
