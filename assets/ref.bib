	abstract = {Shape memory alloys are referred to as a group of alloys that can retrieve the permanent deformation and strain applied to them and eventually return to their original form. So far, various studies have been done to determine the behavior of these alloys under cyclic loading. Most of the studies have mainly been conducted by using the foundations of Continuum Mechanics in order to examine the properties of memory alloys. In this study, instead of using the Continuum Mechanics, a Molecular Dynamics simulation method using Lennard-Jones potential is utilized. The changes in the behavior and properties of memory alloy under cyclic loading are being examined. First, the functional form parameters for the Lennard-Jones potential are solved. Subsequently, these parameters are implemented to evaluate the response to thermal cyclic loading. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the behavior of memory alloys under cyclic loading.},

	abstract = {Sparse matrix representations are ubiquitous in computational science and machine learning, leading to significant reductions in compute time, in comparison to dense representation, for problems that have local connectivity. The adoption of sparse representation in leading ML frameworks such as PyTorch is incomplete, however, with support for both automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration missing. In this work, we present an implementation of a CSR-based sparse matrix wrapper for PyTorch with CUDA acceleration for basic matrix operations, as well as automatic differentiability. We also present several applications of the resulting sparse kernels to optimization problems, demonstrating ease of implementation and performance measurements versus their dense counterparts.

@unpublished{tareqpaper,
	abstract = {Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods are often robust and effective solvers for solving the large and sparse linear systems that arise from discretized PDEs and other problems, relying on heuristic graph algorithms to achieve their performance. Reduction-based AMG (AMGr) algorithms attempt to formalize these heuristics by providing two-level convergence bounds that depend concretely on properties of the partitioning of the given matrix into its fine- and coarse-grid degrees of freedom. MacLachlan and Saad (SISC 2007) proved that the AMGr method yields provably robust two-level convergence for symmetric and positive-definite matrices that are diagonally dominant, with a convergence factor bounded as a function of a coarsening parameter. However, when applying AMGr algorithms to matrices that are not diagonally dominant, not only do the convergence factor bounds not hold, but measured performance is notably degraded. Here, we present modifications to the classical AMGr algorithm that improve its performance on matrices that are not diagonally dominant, making use of strength of connection, sparse approximate inverse (SPAI) techniques, and interpolation truncation and rescaling, to improve robustness while maintaining control of the algorithmic costs. We present numerical results demonstrating the robustness of this approach for both classical isotropic diffusion problems and for non-diagonally dominant systems coming from anisotropic diffusion.

@article{jdpaper,
	abstract = {We demonstrate a successful navigation and docking control system for the John Deere Tango autonomous mower, using only a single camera as the input. This vision-only system is of interest because it is inexpensive, simple for production, and requires no external sensing. This is in contrast to existing systems that rely on integrated position sensors and global positioning system (GPS) technologies. To produce our system we combined a state-of-the-art object detection architecture, You Look Only Once (YOLO), with a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture, Double Deep Q-Networks (Double DQN). The object detection network identifies features on the mower and passes its output to the RL network, providing it with a low-dimensional representation that enables rapid and robust training. Finally, the RL network learns how to navigate the machine to the desired spot in a custom simulation environment. When tested on mower hardware, the system is able to dock with centimeter-level accuracy from arbitrary initial locations and orientations.},

@article{taghibakhshi2022learning,
	abstract = {Formulas have been developed to calculate the forces in a molecular system directly, rather than indirectly through the agency of energy. This permits an independent calculation of the slope of the curves of energy vs. position of the nuclei, and may thus increase the accuracy, or decrease the labor involved in the calculation of these curves. The force on a nucleus in an atomic system is shown to be just the classical electrostatic force that would be exerted on this nucleus by other nuclei and by the electrons' charge distribution. Qualitative implications of this are discussed.},

@article{taghibakhshi2021optimization,
	abstract = {Large sparse linear systems of equations are ubiquitous in science and engineering, such as those arising from discretizations of partial differential equations. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are one of the most common methods of solving such linear systems, with an extensive body of underlying mathematical theory. A system of linear equations defines a graph on the set of unknowns and each level of a multigrid solver requires the selection of an appropriate coarse graph along with restriction and interpolation operators that map to and from the coarse representation. The efficiency of the multigrid solver depends critically on this selection and many selection methods have been developed over the years. Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to directly learn the AMG interpolation and restriction operators, given a coarse graph selection. In this paper, we consider the complementary problem of learning to coarsen graphs for a multigrid solver, a necessary step in developing fully learnable AMG methods. We propose a method using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can learn to perform graph coarsening on small planar training graphs and then be applied to unstructured large planar graphs, assuming bounded node degree. We demonstrate that this method can produce better coarse graphs than existing algorithms, even as the graph size increases and other properties of the graph are varied. We also propose an efficient inference procedure for performing graph coarsening that results in linear time complexity in graph size.

@unpublished{mggnn,
	abstract = {Domain decomposition methods (DDMs) are pop- ular solvers for discretized systems of partial dif- ferential equations (PDEs), with one-level and multilevel variants. These solvers rely on several algorithmic and mathematical parameters, pre- scribing overlap, subdomain boundary conditions, and other properties of the DDM. While some work has been done on optimizing these param- eters, it has mostly focused on the one-level set- ting or special cases such as structured-grid dis- cretizations with regular subdomain construction. In this paper, we propose multigrid graph neural networks (MG-GNN), a novel GNN architecture for learning optimized parameters in two-level DDMs. We train MG-GNN using a new unsuper- vised loss function, enabling effective training on small problems that yields robust performance on unstructured grids that are orders of magnitude larger than those in the training set. We show that MG-GNN outperforms popular hierarchical graph network architectures for this optimization and that our proposed loss function is critical to achieving this improved performance.

@article{taghibakhshi2019three,
	abstract = {Microfluidic cell culture platforms are ideal candidates for modeling the native tumor microenvironment because they can precisely reconstruct in vivo cellular behavior. Moreover, mathematical modeling of tumor growth can pave the way toward description and prediction of growth pattern as well as improving cancer treatment. In this study, a modified mathematical model based on concentration distribution is applied to tumor growth in both conventional static culture and dynamic microfluidic cell culture systems. Apoptosis and necrosis mechanisms are considered as the main inhibitory factors in the model, while tumor growth rate and nutrient consumption rate are modified in both quiescent and proliferative zones. We show that such modification can better predict the experimental results of tumor growth reported in the literature. Using numerical simulations, the effects of the concentrations of the nutrients as well as the initial tumor radius on the tumor growth are investigated and discussed. Furthermore, tumor growth is simulated by taking into account the dynamic perfusion into the proposed model. Subsequently, tumor growth kinetics in a three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic device containing a U-shaped barrier is numerically studied. For this case, the effect of the flow rate of culture medium on tumor growth is investigated as well. Finally, to evaluate the impact of the trap geometry on the tumor growth, a comparison is made between the tumor growth kinetics in two frequently used traps in microfluidic cell culture systems, i.e., the U-shaped barrier and microwell structures. The proposed model can provide insight into better predicting the growth and development of avascular tumor in both static and dynamic cell culture platforms.},
